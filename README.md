# minesweeper-project
A simple minesweeper implementation using `tkinter` and `pygame`.

Contains leaderboard and data visualization functionalities using `plotly`.

## Controls:
- Left click on any unrevealed square to reveal its contents
- Right click on any unrevealed square to flag/unflag it
    - If the number of flags is equal to the clue on a revealed square, right click it to reveal all of its unflagged neighbors

## How to run:
Make sure you have pygame installed (run the command `pip install pygame` from your Anaconda prompt if not).

Then, clone this repository and run main.py from the **/minesweeper-project/pygame** directory.
